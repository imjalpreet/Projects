On the right hand side of the screen, there is a power bar that is placed, which shows the power with which the top will be thrown.

On the bottom of the screen, there is the direction meter that is placed to show the direction of the throw.

Now, on the left hand side of the screen there is a scoreboard, which shows the number of hits by green blocks and number of misses by red blocks.
